- title: "Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future"
  date: 2018-07-15
  author: Vance Ashlee
  description: Going straight to the point, the biography of Elon Musk will
    teach you how to distinguish who is committed to the vision of the company
    and who is not. It's a narrative of his aggressive management style to the
    point the book also becomes a documentary about SpaceX and Tesla.

- title: Functional thinking
  date: 2018-01-12
  author: Neal Ford
  description: As a backend engineer, it is important for me to deal with
    concurrency, paralelism, and the usage of resources. These subjects are so
    complex that they forced functional programming to lift from its grave.
    Shifting from object-oriented to functional is a challenge for a mind that
    has been strugling with objects, design patterns and good practices since
    2002. Dispite having some practice programming in Clojure, a functional
    language, I hope to consolidate my knowledge starting from this book, which
    shows that the main challenge to master a functional language is not the
    syntax, but the paradigm.

  description: In the book <a href="http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/"
    target="_blank">Deep Work</a>, I've learned the behavioral aspect of
    concentration, but there is also the physiological one, which is the quality
    of chemical reactions in the brain!

- title: The First 90 Days
  date: 2017-11-05
  author: Michael D. Watkins
  description: One of the concerns we have in a new job is how long it might
    take to fulfill the expectations of the company. We try to work hard, learn
    fast, be disciplined to be rapidly recognized, but are we doing it right?
    That's a Harvard Business Review book, considered an international
    bestseller and improved from its original release in 2003.

    mitigate that.

- title: The Beauty of Discomfort
  date: 2017-09-27
  author: Amanda Lang
  description: My family and I spent wonderful holidays in Canada this year
    and I found this book in a Toronto bookstore, writen by a Canadian
    bestselling author. Amanda proves her point about discomfort by telling
    stories of people who have endured through their challenging achievements.
    She made sure the stories were sufficiently different to cover most aspects
    of discomfort. After finishing the book, it was clear to me that discomfort
    is actually a personal game changer, but there is no beauty in it. So,
    "Discomfort" would be enough as a title.

- title: Your Code as a Crime Scene
  date: 2017-09-16
  author: Adam Tornhill
  description: The book is good at investigating design issues, but not good
    at solving them. Problems are exposed, but not discussed. The tools
    presented aren't more than scripts that have to be executed manually and in
    the right sequence. There is no dashboard or some sort of continuous
    automated analysis to show the progress of the actions taken after the
    diagnosis.

- title: Programming Beyond Practices: Be More Than Just a Code Monkey
  date: 2017-08-07
  author: Gregory T. Brown
  description: Excellent book! Quite thin but valuable. The author explores the
    topics, which go from requirements discovery and rapid prototyping to
    business analysis and design for maintainability, describing real world
    situations. It is in the same category of The Phoenix Project and The Goal,
    but with more technical details and organized in short stories, instead of a
    long novel.

- title: Unusual Uses For Olive Oil
  date: 2017-06-05
  author: Alexander McCall Smith
  description: Excellent book indeed! It's actually a big surprise to read a
    book published in 2011 that sounds like a classical from the 30's. It uses
    an irreproachable British English, with a modern vocabulary, of course. The
    characters have a provincial behaviour, running stories full of naiveness
    and simplicity, which are the main ingredients of this great comedy.
    Recommended!

- title: The Circle
  date: 2017-05-28
  author: Dave Eggers
  description: The book has a point, a very valid point about lack of privacy
    that leads to totalitarianism, but it was so badly written, with so fragile
    arguments. That's like using StarWars to show democracy is good, but no body
    thinks about politics when watching StarWars. The stories were hard to
    believe, weakly founded, almost scientific fiction, to show that social
    networking may have some sort of hipnotic power over the population while
    robotics might be the real threat nowadays.

- title: This Is Me
  author: Ian Thorpe
  description: Very good book! Despite been labeled as an autobiography and
    written in first person, the book was actually written by a English ghost
    writer. Ian lost a great opportunity to be honest about his sexuality. But
    that's OK because I've learned a good deal of swimming techniques and the
    mindset of a champion.

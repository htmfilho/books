Excellent book! Quite thin but valuable. The author explores the topics, which go from requirements discovery and rapid prototyping to business analysis and design for maintainability, describing real world situations. It is in the same category of The Phoenix Project and The Goal, but with more technical details and organized in short stories, instead of a long novel.

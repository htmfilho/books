This is one of those boring business books (for that, it lost a star in my rating), but it has pretty interesting ideas about entrepreneurship. Well, the world is not only about small companies, so the author decided to write a book for big ones.

I'm one of those guys who enjoy working for big companies, but it was never clear to me how they could become as efficient as startups until I read this book. The idea is not to transform a big company in a big startup, but to make teams function as a startup and to make corporate function as a funding company of those teams.

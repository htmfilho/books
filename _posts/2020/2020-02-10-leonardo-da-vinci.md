Back in 2012, I read the biography of Steve Jobs by the same author. It was one of the best books I ever read. This biography of Leonardo da Vinci is even more detailed and profound. Leonardo was a perfectionist with serious focus issues, who struggled throughout his life to finish his commissions. This is also a contemporary problem that was once related to genius and it is now related to attention disorder.

Walter Isaacson did a great job telling the story of Leonardo da Vinci. There is so much value in this book that it made me regret when I didn't give enough attention to Leonardo's masterpieces while visiting the Louvre in Paris. It had an impact on my thoughts, behaviour, and approach to knowledge acquisition.
